Automated testing of a webpage using Selenium

The Python code uses the Selenium webdriver to retrieve elements from a webpage, check for conditions and return messages to the console. It is useful in automated testing of web applications and can be implemented in a similar fashion by writing a test script using any core programming language followed by it's execution.
